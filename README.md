# SolveTheTrick

Deepak Sharma wants to trick his friends by playing a game where he gives two strings with mixed alphabets, symbols and Numbers where his friends need to solve the trick by giving me some valid strings from those strings.
A valid string should not be Upper Case, no symbols and Not a number.
After that add both valid strings.
